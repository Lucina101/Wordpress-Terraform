"# Wordpress-Terraform" 

Deploy wordpress site with terraform and aws services.
This infrastructure is not free though. I used one forced-paid service, NAT-gateway. (Since I was forced by instructor to use it)
Apart form NAT gateway, most of things should be covered by aws free-tier to some extent. Using two instances will exceed monthly free for sure if they're active for too long.
Do not run it for fun or change NAT gateway to normal internet gateway first.
